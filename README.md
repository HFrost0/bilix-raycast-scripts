# bilix RayCast Scripts

just some useful [raycast](https://raycast.com/) scripts for bilix download. The applescript can be used by
macOS [Automator](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/automator/welcome/mac) as well.

## requirements

1. bilix>=1.0

   since I use `--browser` instead of `--from-browser`. You can modify the script to support bilix<1.0 if you want.
2. raycast

   If you don't have raycast, you can use the applescript in automator.
